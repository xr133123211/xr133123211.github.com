计划每两天翻译一篇quora的回答来温习英语，我只从便于学习英语的角度挑选文章，不代表我会赞同答案和其中的观点。

（第一篇翻译居然就是外国人评价我国的战争观，其中涉及到了南海问题，还有PresidentXI与Hitler的比较，我不能赞同）

Question: Is China eager for war? 

Answered by Thomas Henderson

中国渴望战争吗？


China is ignoring some international pressures such as refusing to conform to international copyright and intellectual property laws but is certainly happy to conform in other areas such as environmentalism, for example China has finally made promises on reducing carbon emissions and has pledged only to use nukes as a response to being nuked.

中国往往会忽视一些国际紧张问题，比如他拒绝遵守国际著作权和知识产权法律。但他却很乐意遵守其他范围内的一些规定。比如在环境保护问题上，中国最终做出了减少碳排放的承诺，他还声明绝不率先使用核武器。

It is true that China is taking the territorial waters of Vietnam and the Philippines which does seem out of order. The Chinese government knows that it can acquire those waters without spilling a drop of blood, if it does 'verge on insanity' it also verges on extreme cunning . Taking land on the other hand is a totally different game and personally I don't think President Xi is nearly as stupid as Hitler in this regard.

毫无疑问的是，中国正在侵占越南和菲律宾的领海，这举措很不合理。中国政府认为他们能不流一滴血地拿下这些领海，这显得要么他是近乎疯狂要么就是近乎极度狡猾了。另一方面，侵占领土是一个完全不同的游戏，我个人认为PXI在就点而言和希特勒一样愚蠢。


China has not been in a proper war since 1953 (excluding a few minor skirmishes with Vietnam and India). it has been one of the most peaceful countries in the second half of the 20th Century and early 21st Century. In a way the acquisition of the South China sea is a peaceful solution since no blood has been split (yet?).

中国自1953年以来再没有陷入过完全战争（除了和越南、印度的小冲突）。他是20世纪后半段和21世纪以来最和平的国家。在某种程度上看，中国获取南海领海采取的也是和平手段，因为这期间没有发生过流血事件（到目前为止）。

China has upgraded and enlarged its military but not 'vastly'. Name a country that hasn't upgraded and enlarged its military recently. Technology around the world is improving rapidly and counties need to constantly upgrade their militaries if they want to defend themselves.

中国升级并扩大了国家军队，但这规模并不夸张。你能报出近来没有发展军队的国家吗？世界各地的技术正在飞速发展，所以各个国家为了保护自己，都必须不断地升级军队。

On Taiwan, the Chinese government knows that it would lose a lot of respect around the world if it tried to take the island by force, it may lead to a world war, possibly nuclear, President Xi is not that stupid. Both Chinese and Taiwanese consider both sides to be two parts of the same nation, the Chinese don't want to kill their brothers and sisters in Taiwan, they want to acquire the island peacefully.

在台湾问题上，中国政府明白，如果他们采用暴力手段夺回领土的话，他们在世界各地内失去尊重。这可能导致世界大战，乃至核战争。PXI没有那么愚蠢。中国大陆和台湾人民都认为两边属于一个国家，中国人民并不想杀害姐妹同胞，他们希望和平收复岛屿。

On the border issues, yes China has disputed territory with India and Pakistan but that hasn't stopped them having good relations, Pakistan is one of China's closest allies and India has never been as friendly with China. Both sides refuse to discuss the border issues because they don't want to bring up awkward points of contention with their allies.

在边界为提上，中国和印度、巴基斯坦有争议领土，但这并没有妨碍他们的良好关系。巴基是中国最亲密的盟友，印度从来没有和中国这么有好过。他们双方都拒绝讨论边境问题，因为他们都不想和盟友提起有争议的论点。

So no, China is not eager for war, it sees the goals it can achieve without war and takes them. China can become the most powerful country in the world without a conflict due the sheer size of its population and its explosive economic growth.

所以（我的回答是）不，中国不渴望战争，他选择不用战争就可以实现的目标并实现他们。中国在不发生冲突的情况下变身世界大国的原因是他庞大的人口和爆炸性的经济增长。

At the moment China has a very competent leader, let's hope the next president is not as greedy and stupid as Hitler.
