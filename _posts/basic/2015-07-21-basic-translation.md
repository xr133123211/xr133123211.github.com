1.Is China eager for war? 
	answered by thomas henderson

  1. China is ignoring some international pressures such as refusing to conform to international copyright and intellectual property laws but is certainly happy to conform in other areas such as environmentalism, for example China has finally made promises on reducing carbon emissions and has pledged only to use nukes as a response to being nuked.

2. It is true that China is taking the territorial waters of Vietnam and the Philippines which does seem out of order. The Chinese government knows that it can acquire those waters without spilling a drop of blood, if it does 'verge on insanity' it also verges on extreme cunning . Taking land on the other hand is a totally different game and personally I don't think President Xi is nearly as stupid as Hitler in this regard.

3. China has not been in a proper war since 1953 (excluding a few minor skirmishes with Vietnam and India). it has been one of the most peaceful countries in the second half of the 20th Century and early 21st Century. In a way the acquisition of the South China sea is a peaceful solution since no blood has been split (yet?).

4. China has upgraded and enlarged its military but not 'vastly'. Name a country that hasn't upgraded and enlarged its military recently. Technology around the world is improving rapidly and counties need to constantly upgrade their militaries if they want to defend themselves.

On Taiwan, the Chinese government knows that it would lose a lot of respect around the world if it tried to take the island by force, it may lead to a world war, possibly nuclear, President Xi is not that stupid. Both Chinese and Taiwanese consider both sides to be two parts of the same nation, the Chinese don't want to kill their brothers and sisters in Taiwan, they want to acquire the island peacefully.

On the border issues, yes China has disputed territory with India and Pakistan but that hasn't stopped them having good relations, Pakistan is one of China's closest allies and India has never been as friendly with China. Both sides refuse to discuss the border issues because they don't want to bring up awkward points of contention with their allies.

So no, China is not eager for war, it sees the goals it can achieve without war and takes them. China can become the most powerful country in the world without a conflict due the sheer size of its population and its explosive economic growth.

At the moment China has a very competent leader, let's hope the next president is not as greedy and stupid as Hitler.
